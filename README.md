## Conclusions
Created a model using ridge regression to predict price of house in Australian market. Features that highly impact the prediction are found to be 
 |  GrLivArea    |  Above grade (ground) living area square feet  |
 |  OverallQual  |  Rates the overall material and finish of the house  |
